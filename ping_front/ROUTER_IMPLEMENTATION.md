# PING Frontend - React Router Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the React Router DOM implementation added to the PING frontend application to provide proper routing functionality while maintaining all existing features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `react-router-dom`: Main routing library
- `@types/react-router-dom`: TypeScript types for React Router DOM

### 2. New Files Created
- `useAuth.ts`: Custom hook for authentication management
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: Error handling component
- `LoadingSpinner.tsx`: Loading indicator component
- `NotFound.tsx`: 404 page component

### 3. Modified Files

#### `src/App.tsx`
- Completely restructured to use React Router
- Added protected routes for authenticated pages
- Added proper route handling with 404 support

#### `src/main.tsx`
- Updated to use the new App component with routing
- Added ErrorBoundary wrapper for better error handling

#### `src/Login.tsx`
- Added navigation after successful login using `useAuth` hook
- Integrated with React Router navigation

#### `src/Dashboard.tsx`
- Added logout functionality using `useAuth` hook
- Added logout button in the dashboard header
- Maintained all existing functionality (teams, dangers, signals, etc.)

#### `src/types.ts`
- Enhanced type definitions to support the existing functionality
- Added optional properties for better TypeScript compatibility

#### `src/TeamDetail.tsx`
- Updated to use shared type definitions
- Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues

### 4. Routing Structure

```
/ (root)
├── /login (public)
├── /dashboard/* (protected)
└── * (404 page)
```

### 5. Authentication Flow

1. **Unauthenticated users**: Redirected to `/login`
2. **Login success**: User redirected to `/dashboard`
3. **Authenticated users**: Access to dashboard and all sub-features
4. **Logout**: Token removed, user redirected to `/login`

### 6. Protected Routes
All routes except `/login` require authentication (valid token in localStorage).

### 7. Features Maintained
- User authentication (login/register)
- Dashboard with team management
- Signal danger reporting
- Team details with maps
- Add team functionality
- Danger management
- All existing CSS styling and functionality

## Usage

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Navigation
- Direct URL access works for all routes
- Browser back/forward buttons work correctly  
- Refresh maintains current state (with authentication check)

## Key Benefits

1. **URL-based navigation**: Users can bookmark specific pages
2. **Browser history support**: Back/forward buttons work properly
3. **Protected routes**: Automatic authentication checking
4. **Error handling**: Graceful error boundaries and 404 pages
5. **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support
6. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of routing logic

## Authentication Hook (`useAuth`)

```typescript
const { isAuthenticated, logout, loginWithToken } = useAuth()
```

- `isAuthenticated()`: Check if user is logged in
- `logout()`: Remove token and redirect to login
- `loginWithToken(token)`: Store token and redirect to dashboard

This implementation preserves all existing functionality while adding robust routing capabilities to the PING application.
